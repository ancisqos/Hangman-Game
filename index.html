	  //VARIABLES and ARRAYS//
	  //=========================================================

	  //Here is where we will define our variables for the Hangman game

    var appState = {}

    //Creates array that lists out every possible key choice
    var letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k", "l", "m", "n", "o", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "u", "v", "w", "x", "y", "z"]

    //variable for Wins
   

    //Array of band names.
    var bandsArray = ["black sabbath", "iron maiden", "metallica", "slayer", "pantera", "megadeth", "judas priest", "anthrax", ];

    //Randomly chooses a band from the bands array.
    var randomBand = bandsArray[Math.floor(Math.random()*bandsArray.length)];

      console.log(randomBand);




	  //FUNCTIONS//
	  //=========================================================

	  //Here is where we will set our functions for the Hangman game
 
    //Function to initialize game

    //Number of guesses remaining
      //function to countdown the number of guesses and display it

    //Letters already guessed
      //function to display the incorrect letters that were guessed. if a letter was already guessed, function so that number of guesses does not change and the letter does not get added again

    //Function that updates score (keeps track of wins)
    // function updateScore() {
    //     document.querySelector("#score").innerHTML = "Score: " + score;

	  //=========================================================

    //When user presses key, it will run the following function:

    document.onkeyup = function(event) {
      var userguess = String.fromCharCode(event.keyCode).toLowerCase();

      console.log(userguess);
