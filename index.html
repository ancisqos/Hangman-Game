      //What we need:

      //PRESS ANY KEY TO GET STARTED! 
      //Write function to initialize game

      //WINS 
      //function to keep track of wins

      //CURRENT WORD  
      //function to generate random word, the blank _ _ _ _ _ _ _ for the words, the spaces getting filled as letters are guessed

      var word = "black sabbath";
      var wordLength = word.length;
      var underscores = "";
      for(i=0; i<wordLength; i++) {
    underscores = underscores + "_ "
    }

      //NUMBER OF GUESSES REMAINING 
      //function to countdown the number of guesses and display it

      //LETTERS ALREADY GUESSED 
      //function to display the incorrect letters that were guessed. if a letter was already guessed, function so that number of guesses does not change and the letter does not get added again

      //WIN SCREEN
      //function to display a win screen when the correct answer is guessed?

      //LOOP
      //when game is won, show win screen/answer/picture and loop function to initialize game

	  //VARIABLES and ARRAYS//
	  //=========================================================

	  //Here is where we will define our variables for the Hangman game

    //Creates array that lists out every possible key choice
    var letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k", "l", "m", "n", "o", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "u", "v", "w", "x", "y", "z"]

    //variable for Wins
    var wins = 0;

    //Array of band names.
    var bandsArray = ["black sabbath", "iron maiden", "metallica", "slayer", "pantera"];

    //Randomly chooses a band from the bands array.
    var randomBand = bandsArray[Math.floor(Math.random() * bandsArray.length)];


	  //FUNCTIONS//
	  //=========================================================

	  //Here is where we will set our functions for the Hangman game

    //Function to initialize game


    //Function that updates score (keeps track of wins)
    function updateScore() {
        document.querySelector("#score").innerHTML = "Score: " + score;
      }
	  //MAIN PROCESS
	  //=========================================================

    //When user presses key, it will run the following function:

    document.onkeyup = function(event) {
      console.log(onkeyup);
